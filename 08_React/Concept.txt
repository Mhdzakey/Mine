React:
    JS Library
    Just like C++ STL Library for C++.

    Magical Line:
        React is all about component
                                    A resuable piece of code.
                                    A Custom HTML element
Why React:
         Just JS is just imperative(what and how) approach
         React is declarative(what)
         easily UI creation
         Reusibilty
         Don't Repeat Yourself
         Readibilty
         Separation of concern
         increses MAintability


         SPA(Sngle Page Approach)
