Object:  
    Key value pair 
    or 
    Multiple linked variables in a single variable 
    {} = object literal
    {properties of objects }
    function in object is called method

best practice of Creating Object:
    
    1: Factory function : Came case Notation
    
             function creates objects then return it.
    
    2: Constructor function: Pascal Notation i.e NumberOFStudents

            It initialize/define properties/method of anobject.

            this = Reference of the current object
            new  = create empty object


Dynamic Nature of Objects:
    ...
    Function is also objects in JS


Funciton are Objects in JS.




Types in JS are two Types 
                        1:Primitve   ->  Number,String,Boolean,Undefined,Null
                        2:Reference  -> Functions, objects, arrays -> all are objects

Difference between primitve vs Reference
        primitve:
        // primitve are copied by their value.
            function call hotay waqat copy creat hote hay 
        Objects or Reference:
        // reference are copied by their address or refernce.
            function call hotay waqat same address ko difference/same name point lar rahy hotay hay


iterating through Objects
    
    For-in 
    For-of  
        using object.Keys(objectName)
        using object.enteries(objectName)


Object Cloning:
 
 iteration
 Assign
 Spread
