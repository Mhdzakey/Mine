HTML = Skeleton of Web = what
CSS  = Apperance       = Style
Javascript = Process or Functionality or behaviour of web html tag = Logic

What is Javascript?
    To implement behavoir or functionality of web.
    Client Side language or scripting(To do what and how) language
    Developed by    
                Netscape in 1995 in 10 days.
Tips:-          StartUp is good for fresher.

What can we do with js?
    Everyting nearly.

How to Run JS?
    Using JS Engine.   

FirFox Engine is SpiderMonkey.
Chrome Engine is V8.

Adding C++ program with js by using Node(Can be execute outside the brower).

Best Position to add JS Script at the end of html to improve UX.

Separation of Concern Principle 

Variables
    let


Scope 
    let is nearst Block Scope {}, rediclation is possible of variable
    var is global scope
    In JavaScript, var variables can be re-declared within the same 
    scope without causing an error. This behavior is known as "variable hoisting." When you re-declare a variable using var, it essentially updates the existing variable rather than creating a new one.
    However, this behavior can lead to unexpected results and is generally considered a bad practice. It can cause confusion and make code harder to maintain.
    This is one of the reasons why let and const were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).
    Unlike var, variables declared with let and const cannot be re-declared within the same scope. If you try to re-declare a variable using let, it will result in a syntax error.

Constants
    Value of variable can not be change

Variable Naming
    Rules
        cannot be a reserved keyword {let, if, var etc}
        meaningful
        cannot start with a number
        cannot contain space or -
        CamelCase first letter will small second word first charcter will be Capital i.e muhammadZakey

Primitve DataTypes
    String. sequence of characters
    Number. int and float
    Boolean. two values
    Undefined. by default undeclarad var value is undefined.
    Null. Empty or Clear a variable value.

Dynamic Typing
    

Reference Types
    Objects:   Multiple variables linked or key values pair
    Arrays:    DataStructure used to conatin a list of items 
    Functions: 


Operator:
    arithmetic - + * / % **
    assignment  
        Pre = Firstly increment the value Secondly use the value 
        post = Firstly use the value secondly increment the value
        pre-increment     pre-decement
        post-increment    post-decement

    comparison > < >= <= ==={Strict Equality} !== Not Equal.
        
        Loose Equality    ==     value just same i will work     
        
        Strict Equality   ===    value and data must be same

        Ternary Operator       Condition ? true : false

    bitwise
        Bitwise AND &
        Bitwise OR |

    logical       
        AND.
        OR.  Short Circuting 
        NOT. 

        With Non Boolean
            concept of  FAlse and Truth
            Falsey             vs        Truthy     
                Undefined                   Anything that is not Falsey
                Null
                0
                false
                ' '
                NaN

Operator Precedence
    

Control Satements

if-else
if-elseif-else
Switch case


Loops: Repetition of tasks
    For Loop :       for(initialzation; condition; Updation){}
    While Loop :        
                        initialzation
                        while(condition)
                        {
                            Updation
                        }

    Do-while Loop :     
                    do
                    {
                    Updation
                    }
                    while(condition)
                    
                    Atleast one time execute due to do.
